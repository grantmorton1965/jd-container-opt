# jd-container-opt

Context:

John Deere’s Mattoon IL business unit is transitioning to a new warehouse management system.​ John Deere has tasked the JD Container Team to determine the Standard Quantity for SKUs in six storage containers.​

Standard Quantity = the maximum number of boxes of a specific SKU that can fit into each of the six storage containers without overlap and within their size constraints.​

Establishing Standard Quantity will ensure:​
	
 	consistent packing standards across units ​
	
 	maximized storage density ​
	
 	enhanced labor efficiency​

Explore various box orientations and stacking patterns to maximize volume utilization will enable John Deere to apply these optimized packing strategies across all SKUs in their system for enhanced operational efficiency.

Using the Py3dbp Library​:

	Handles 3D packing: Designed for complex three-dimensional packing challenges.​

	Flexible for various shapes: Can manage a wide variety of shapes, adaptable to different use cases.​
