# jd-container-opt
Context:

John Deere’s Mattoon IL business unit is transitioning to a new warehouse management system.​ John Deere has tasked the JD Container Team to determine the Standard Quantity for SKUs in six storage containers.​

Standard Quantity = the maximum number of boxes of a specific SKU that can fit into each of the six storage containers without overlap and within their size constraints.​

Establishing Standard Quantity will ensure:​
	
 	consistent packing standards across units ​
	
 	maximized storage density ​
	
 	enhanced labor efficiency​
Explore various box orientations and stacking patterns to maximize volume utilization will enable John Deere to apply these optimized packing strategies across all SKUs in their system for enhanced operational efficiency.

How run?

Install python in your local. 

Open final -> jd_container_optimize.ipynb and run using python libraries. 

 If you want to use custom dimention then answer 'Do you want to use custom package dimensions? (yes/no): yes'
 
        -> Then it will generate report based on the excel('Optimization Problem.xlsx)
        
        -> If you answer 'no' -- You need to enter the component id, length, width and high. 
		
Attached sample out puts of both packing_report1.html and packing_report2.html.
